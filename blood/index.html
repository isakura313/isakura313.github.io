                <p> For an unknown reason, the Hunter travels to Yharnam, home to Blood Healing, a powerful blood remedy that is believed to cure all diseases. Upon arriving, the Hunter receives a blood transfusion from the Blood Minister in Iosefka's Clinic. Said blood grants the Hunter the abilities necessary to participate in the hunt, such as being able to heal themself with blood vials. </p>
                   <p> After waking up from the transfusion, the Hunter finds a note that tells them to seek the Paleblood to "transcend the hunt". The Hunter then exits Iosefka's Clinic only to be killed by a beast. They wake up again, now in the Hunter's Dream, a place they will travel every time they die in Yharnam. There, the Hunter receives weapon gifts from the Messengers, small skeleton-like creatures that help the hunters trapped in the Dream. The Hunter then returns to Yharnam where they, now equipped with the gifts, is able to slay hostile men and beasts alike. Traveling to the Dream once again, the Hunter meets a Plain Doll, who helps them channel Blood Echoes from their slain enemies into their strength. They also meet Gherman, an ex-hunter bound to a wheelchair who just tells them to enjoy the hunt, and that the Dream is now the Hunter's home. </p>
                    <p>At Central Yharnam, the Hunter meets Gilbert, a sick man who also came to Yharnam seeking a cure, who speaks to them from inside his home through a window. He points the player towards the Cathedral Ward, home of the Healing Church, telling them that it's the place where the Hunter will most likely find the Paleblood they seek. </p>

        <div class="premises_wrapper_avatar_text">    <p>  Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 â€“ March 15, 1937) was an American writer who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. He was virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, but he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre.</p></div>

                            <h3>Non-human influences on humanity</h3>
                            <p>The beings of Lovecraft's mythos often have human servants; Cthulhu, for instance, is worshiped under various names by cults among both the Greenlandic Inuit and voodoo circles of Louisiana, and in many other parts of the world.</p><p>These worshippers served a useful narrative purpose for Lovecraft. Many beings of the Mythos were too powerful to be defeated by human opponents, and so horrific that direct knowledge of them meant insanity for the victim. When dealing with such beings, Lovecraft needed a way to provide exposition and build tension without bringing the story to a premature end. Human followers gave him a way to reveal information about their "gods" in a diluted form, and also made it possible for his protagonists to win paltry victories. Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, envisioned "savages" as closer to supernatural knowledge unknown to civilized man.</p>

                            <h3>Civilization under threat</h3>
                           <p> Lovecraft was familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist Oswald Spengler, whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall anti-modern worldview. Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is present in particular in At the Mountains of Madness. S. T. Joshi, in H. P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West, places Spengler at the center of his discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas.</p>
                        <p>Lovecraft wrote to Clark Ashton Smith in 1927: "It is my belief, and was so long before Spengler put his seal of scholarly proof on it, that our mechanical and industrial age is one of frank decadence". Lovecraft was also acquainted with the writings of another German philosopher of decadence: Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>

                        <h3> Risks of a scientific era</h3>
                       <p> At the turn of the 20th century, humanity's increased reliance upon science was both opening new worlds and solidifying understanding of ours. </p> <p>Lovecraft portrays this potential for a growing gap of man's understanding of the universe as a potential for horror, most notably in "The Colour Out of Space", where the inability of science to comprehend a contaminated meteorite leads to horror. In a letter to James F. Morton in 1923, Lovecraft specifically pointed to Einstein's theory on relativity as throwing the world into chaos and making the cosmos a jest; in a letter to Woodburn Harris in 1929, he speculated that technological comforts risk the collapse of science. Indeed, at a time when men viewed science as limitless and powerful, Lovecraft imagined alternative potential and fearful outcomes. </p>
                                    
                    </div>
        <div class="premises_fourth_column">
            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>Lovecraft's works are ruled by several distinct pantheons of deities (actually aliens worshiped as such by humans) who are either indifferent or actively hostile to humanity.</p><p> Lovecraft's actual philosophy has been termed "cosmic indifference" and this is expressed in his fiction. Several of Lovecraft's stories of the Old Ones (alien beings of the Cthulhu Mythos) propose alternate mythic human origins in contrast to those found in the creation stories of existing religions, expanding on a natural world view. For instance, in Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness it is proposed that humankind was actually created as a slave race by the Old Ones, and that life on Earth as we know it evolved from scientific experiments abandoned by the Elder Things. Protagonist characters in Lovecraft are usually educated men, citing scientific and rational evidence to support their non-faith.</p>
